It feels like I'm going back in time to 2003 or so, when I worked a little bit
with Tuomo Valkonen on pwm, a predecessor to the somewhat famous window manager
ion. That's the last time I had any inclination to put any time or effort into 
fine tuning my UI experience. 

In the mean time I have been content with out-of-the box experience on KDE or
Gnome. Briefly, I tried going back to my childhood favorite, fvwm, but it didn't
really live up to the nostalgia. 

Now, I'm finding myself lost in windows on a pretty regular basis. The wonderful
[coverflow] shell extension makes it at least easy to find the windows, but 
it's still very hard to keep your desktop organized. 

So, introducing [snap-to-neighbors] shell extension. It offers a keyboard shortcut
to resize and move currently active window to exactly fit to the space available 
around the top left corner of the window.
